# jedit_modes

Additional modes for jEdit including:

* HAML, created by [Jim Morris](http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2006/12/1/a-haml-edit-mode-for-jedit)
* markdown, created by Peter Lynch based on prior work by Ali Rantakari
* ruby, Ian Maclean with additional work by Chris Morris

## Installation

These files belong inside the `modes` directory within your jEdit settings directory (whose location varies by system).

You also need a `catalog` file in the same directory, describing each mode that you want jEdit to use.

There is a catalog in this repository, which will work for these modes only, but you should not use it to overwrite your existing catalog if you've installed other modes.
